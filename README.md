### 🧠 Overview
This repository accompanies the survey paper:

> *Threat-Driven Frameworks for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: A Practitioner’s Guide (2017–2025)*  
> Focused on mapping privacy threats (membership inference, model inversion, data extraction, poisoning, gradient leakage) to practical mitigation frameworks and decision matrices.

The repository provides all supplementary materials—benchmark tables, figures, framework metrics, and extended notes—to support reproducibility and practitioner reference.

### 🧩 Methodology Summary
- *Data collection:* Canonical threat papers (2015–2024) via Scholarcy summarization.  
- *Framework mapping:* Evaluated frameworks include Opacus, TensorFlow Privacy, Flower, FATE, CrypTen, TenSEAL, Microsoft SEAL, and NVIDIA FLARE.  
- *Synthesis:* Mapped each framework’s defensive scope (DP, FL, SMPC, HE) to corresponding threat vectors.  
- *Decision matrix:* Built based on criteria—usability, scalability, and real-world adoption.

### 🧱 Future Work
This repository will expand with the experimental follow-up paper:
> *Secure and Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Parameter-Efficient Methods (DP + LoRA)*

That companion repo (tentative name: Privtune-DP-LoRA-Benchmark) will benchmark Opacus + Flower for differential-privacy fine-tuning in non-IID settings.
